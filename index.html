    <p>Colombia is a very beautiful country to visit. It gets a lot of bad news from its past. Once you give it a chance you will see how friendly everyone is and willing to help. It is a wonderful country to live in and tour as well. Eat a lot of amazing foods and different kinds of drinks. It is an experiance of a life time. You would not regret it at all.</p>
